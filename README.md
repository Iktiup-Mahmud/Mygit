# Mygit
# MyGit

MyGit is a custom version control system built from scratch using Node.js, inspired by Git. This project is designed to simulate basic Git functionality, such as creating repositories, committing changes, and managing branches, with the goal of understanding the inner workings of version control systems.

## Features

- **`mygit init`**: Initialize a new Git repository in the current directory.
- **`mygit add`**: Stage changes for commit.
- **`mygit commit`**: Commit changes to the repository.
- **`mygit status`**: View the status of the repository (untracked files, changes to be committed, etc.).
- **`mygit branch`**: List, create, and delete branches.
- **`mygit log`**: View commit history.
- **`mygit merge`**: Merge one branch into another.

## Installation

To install and use **MyGit** locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher) and **npm** are required.
- Ensure that `git` is installed (for testing purposes, if you want to compare with Git).

### Steps to Install

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Iktiup-Mahmud/Mygit.git
